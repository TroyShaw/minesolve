Implement highscore system
    records top 10 scores for 3 game modes: easy, medium, hard
    if you beat a highscore when you win, it prompts for your name, then puts it in highscores
    clicking the "highscore" menu item from the menu brings up a window displaying all highscores

Implement proper solver
    At the moment the solver is pretty ad-hoc and the file needs refactoring.
    The solver itself also is pretty simple, and there are many rules which can be added which would be interesting.

Fix solver/ game interface
    At the moment there is flickering and weirdness with how the solver and the GUI interact.
    This needs to be fixed.

General tidyup and refactorings
    There are lots of things that could be updated and fixed. These all need to be done.
