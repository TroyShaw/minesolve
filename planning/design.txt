This document describes the design of the MineSweeper game.




Packages
=========


highscore
---------

This class handles all the code related to highscores.
TODO


images
------

This package contains code related to loading the image assets used by the GUI.

This version of minesweeper uses a single sprite-sheet which contains the graphics for everything.
The ImageData class basically extracts all of the subimages from the main spritesheet and makes them accessible.
The class also allows loading of new skins at runtime. 



main

Simply instantiates a GameFrame, which starts a new game of minesweeper.
