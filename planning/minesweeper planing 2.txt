fulfilled adjacent flags/ empty

if a square isn't fully flagged
	if all satisfying flag instances result in a flag being adjacent to a square which has empty squares (that aren't the same squares as those adjacent to original square) the same number as remaining flags, then we can flag those squares.
	same as other except if a flag(s) is adjacent in all configurations and that flag then satisfies the square, we can click the squares that aren't the same squares as those adjacent to original square.

click algorithms
================
if a square with x adjacent mines has x adjacent flags, we can safely click all adjacent empty squares


flag algorithms
===============
if empty adjacent squares is same number as mines on square - number of adjacent flagged squares, we can flag remaining non-flagged squares.
if we enumerate all possible flag permutations for a square, remove the ones that are illegal based of adjacent squares, then take the union of the remaining selections, the flags in the union can be safely flagged.
